              Dining, shopping, and nightlife opportunities abound in the
              coastal beach city of Tel Aviv, which in many ways can feel like
              the American city of Miami. You will see vibrant graffiti art,
              modern architecture as well as the largest collection of Bauhaus
              buildings in the world, and plenty of boutiques selling everything
              from textiles to home goods to clothing to furniture. Walk along
              the beach promenade or take a tour of the area via bicycle or
              Segway. Be sure to visit Carmel Market to sample different types
              of Israeli foods and drinks, influenced by a multitude of
              cultures. Explore the winding and narrow streets of Jaffa Old
              City, also known as Yafo, and its port. The contrast of the oldest
              port in the world, home to multiethnic communities, next to the
              modern city of Tel Aviv is stark. See the Jaffa Clock Tower, Saint
              Nicholas Monastery, the Great Mahmoudiya Mosque, the Old Jaffa
              Museum of Antiquities, and several gardens, squares, and
              courtyards.

              Gethsemane, where Jesus prayed before crucifixion.

              Eilat is a southern Israeli port and resort town on the Red Sea,
              near Jordan. Its beaches are noted for their calm waters, like
              Dolphin Reef, where the aquatic mammals are often spotted. Known
              for snorkeling and diving, Coral Beach Nature Reserve has
              buoy-marked underwater trails among fish-filled reefs. Nearby
              Coral World Underwater Observatory Marine Park has a
              glass-enclosed observation center submerged offshore.
