            The best time to visit Israel is typically in the spring (March to
            May) or during the fall (September to November). At these times,
            you'll likely find fewer crowds, cheaper accommodations, and the
            best weather (even for hitting the beach). Summer is the most
            popular and therefore the most crowded, but it can often be
            extremely hot and unpleasant. Whenever you decide to go, use this
            guide to help plan your trip to this tiny but fascinating country
            known for its rich culture, fascinating history, stunning beaches,
            and eclectic food.

            Peak Season in Israel

            Despite the often oppressive heat, summer (July and August) is still
            the most popular time for tourists to visit Israel, and prices
            usually reflect that. The week of Passover in the spring is probably
            the next-most popular time to visit. With schools, workplaces, and
            many government offices closed for the entire week, attractions,
            beaches, hotels, and restaurants can get quite crowded and
            expensive. Book early the trip to Israel if you plan to come during
            Passover.
