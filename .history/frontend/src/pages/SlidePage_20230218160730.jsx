              Dining, shopping, and nightlife opportunities abound in the
              coastal beach city of Tel Aviv, which in many ways can feel like
              the American city of Miami. You will see vibrant graffiti art,
              modern architecture as well as the largest collection of Bauhaus
              buildings in the world, and plenty of boutiques selling everything
              from textiles to home goods to clothing to furniture. Walk along
              the beach promenade or take a tour of the area via bicycle or
              Segway. Be sure to visit Carmel Market to sample different types
              of Israeli foods and drinks, influenced by a multitude of
              cultures. Explore the winding and narrow streets of Jaffa Old
              City, also known as Yafo, and its port. The contrast of the oldest
              port in the world, home to multiethnic communities, next to the
              modern city of Tel Aviv is stark. See the Jaffa Clock Tower, Saint
              Nicholas Monastery, the Great Mahmoudiya Mosque, the Old Jaffa
              Museum of Antiquities, and several gardens, squares, and
              courtyards.

              epicenter for religious faith, sacred to millions of people for
              thousands of years. Tourists, entering through one of seven
              entrances (the New Gate, Damascus Gate, Herod’s Gate, Lions’ Gate,
              Dung Gate, Zion Gate, and Jaffa Gate), explore the four uneven
              quarters—Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Armenian—within the stone
              walls. Visit religious sites, look for goods throughout the many
              stalls in the quarters, and dine out in any of the various
              eateries. The top must-see sites to experience here are the
              Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and Temple Mount.

              Located in east Jerusalem, near the Old City, Mount of Olives is a
              worthwhile place to visit to gain perspective of the land—you can
              see far and wide over the Kidron Valley to Jerusalem and Temple
              Mount when standing on this mountain. Olive groves once covered
              this Jewish burial ground, which has been the resting place for
              notable Jewish biblical figures for thousands of years. Dome of
              the Ascension, where Jesus is said to have made his last footprint
              on Earth, is located in these hills as is the Garden of
              Gethsemane, where Jesus prayed before crucifixion.

              moving sight for people of any faith but particularly those of the
              Jewish religion. Millions of pilgrims make their way here each
              year to pray, read scripture, and write prayers and wishes on
              pieces of paper that then get wedged into the cracks of the
              limestone wall, the only remainder of the wall surrounding the
              Temple Mount and the site of the First and Second Temples of

              by the Romans. The wall is divided for men and women in Prayer
