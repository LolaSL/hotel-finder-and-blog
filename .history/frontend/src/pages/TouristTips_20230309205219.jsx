            It could happen that you have no choice but to organize your trip
            during August, Easter or Christmas holidays. Of course during this
            time your journey becomes more expensive. If you have the power to
            choose, then do not travel during this time. The difference between
            traveling in September instead of August can be seen from your
            wallet. Think about it!

            7. Cheap can sometimes be expensive
          </h2>
          <article>
            Never trust bargains. Always carefully check what is included in
            your room price. Does it make sense to pay for a accommodation that
            does not provide WI-FI, breakfast or airport transfer? Most likely
            some of these services are key to you.

            8. Always book in advance and with the refund option.
          </h2>
          <article>
            With this option your room could cost 5%-10% more, but in the long
            run you will notice the difference. Surely you will have more
            flexibility with the dates. Also, if you end up finding something
            cheaper you have the option to cancel the previous reservation and
            book the cheapest one. Some hotels offer you the option to cancel
            your reservation on the same day of your arrival. Despite this, do
            not forget to carefully read about cancellation policies!

          <article>
            Look up on the internet for forums or ask around what is the price
            for public transports. If the price is high, maybe your best
            decisions is to stay in the city centre area. If the bus/metro
            tickets are cheap then you expand your visit in more rural areas and
            reach them by public transports.

            10. Spend more than one night in the same area.
          </h2>
          <article>
            You will probably think: “Why should I spend more nights in the same
            place?”. It is simple. Many hotels offer “third/fourth free night”
            promotions. If your plan was to move around, then think carefully.

          <article>
            Concerts, or events such as St. Patrick in Dublin or the Oktoberfest
            in Munich are situations that can drastically increase the price of
            your accommodation. Recommended you to check the area you would like
            to visit if there are any events occurring so you can plan well your
            stay.

            12. Forget about Friday Night.

          <article>
            Could be that this piece of advice is not for everyone, but it still
            believable it could be a game changer. Usually Friday nights are the
            most expensive nights of the week. People usually take advantage of
            weekends and just pull up the prices. Try to start your trip in the
            early hours of Saturday. You can always leave your bags at the
            reception desk and check in later after you visited the city.

          <article>
            This is key when you are organizing your trip . Always look at the
            opinions that former guests gave to hotels. Price is not everything.
            Their opinion can be your guide to decide your perfect
            accommodation. But be careful! Do not become obsessed by them.

            Many hotels offer some space on their reservation page where you can
            include a promotional code which can help you to save some money.
            Where can you find these codes? You will have to look for them
            online. Just recommended you to download the app Honey.

            Do you want to be the first one to know about any discounts? The
            best way to stay informed with this is by subscribing to
            newsletters. If a hotel launches new promotions and offers, the
            newsletter will always inform you about them.
